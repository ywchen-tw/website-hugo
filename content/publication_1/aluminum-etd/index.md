abstract: An eco-friendly electrochemical approach, including base and acid treatments, and anodization, has been developed for preparation of defect-rich porous aluminum electrodes for efficient hydrogen evolution. A small Tafel slope value of 43 mV dec−1 reveals improved reaction kinetics through the micropores, 3D channels, and zig-zag edges of the aluminum electrode. It exhibits an onset potential of 460 mV and an overpotential of 580 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 due to the porous and edge structures that enhance the charge transfer and mass transport.
