abstract: We have devised a unique strategy for highly sensitive, selective, and colorimetric detection of mercury based on analyte-induced enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au nanospheres (TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au NSs) toward degradation of methylene blue (MB). Through electrostatic interactions, Au nanoparticles are attached to poly-(sodium 4-styreneulfonate)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, which then form an Au shell on each TiO<sub>2</sub> core through reduction of Au<sup>3+</sup> with ascorbic acid. Notably, the deposition of Hg species (Hg<sup>2+</sup>/CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>+</sup>) onto TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au NSs through strong Au–Hg aurophilic interactions speeds up catalytic degradation of MB. The first-order degradation rates of MB by TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au NSs and TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au–Hg NSs are 1.4 × 10−2 min−1 and 2.1 × 10−2 min−1, respectively. Using a commercial absorption spectrometer, the TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au NSs/MB approach provides linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98) for Hg<sup>2+</sup> over a concentration range of 10.0 to 100.0 nM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.5 nM. On the other hand, using a low-cost smartphone app that records the color changes (ΔRGB) of MB solution based on the red–blue–green (RGB) component values, the TiO<sub>2</sub>–Au NSs/MB approach provides an LOD of 2.0 nM for Hg<sup>2+</sup> and 5.0 nM for CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>+</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, the smartphone app sensing system has been validated for the analyses of various samples, including tap water, lake water, soil, and Dorm II, showing its great potential for on-line analysis of environmental and biological samples.
