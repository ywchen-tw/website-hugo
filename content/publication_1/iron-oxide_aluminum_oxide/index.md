abstract: Iron oxide/aluminum oxide microboxes (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MBs) with cubic structures (1 ± 0.09 μm) possessing large specific surface area (208.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and high adsorption capacity (216 mg g<sup>-1</sup>) were prepared and utilized for the removal of mercury (Hg<sup>2+</sup>) (100 ppm) from various samples, including tap water, lake water and tomato juice, with efficiencies of 98.2 ± 0.4, 98.5 ± 0.3 and 97.1 ± 0.5%, respectively. The Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MBs are stable, allowing the adsorbed metal species to be removed from their surfaces with 2 M HCl. The Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MBs can be reused up to five times after being treated with 2 M HCl. Furthermore, the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MBs are efficient adsorbents for the removal of four metal ions such as Hg<sup>2+</sup>, cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>), copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), and lead (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) ions from soil samples, mainly because of a synergetic effect provided by the two metal oxides and high surface area. This low-cost, effective, and stable Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> adsorbent holds great potential for the removal of Hg<sup>2+</sup> and other heavy metal ions from contaminated sources such as water and soil.
