abstract: "The impact of local and neighboring pollutions due to increasing emissions from major stationary pollution sources, such as thermal power plants and industrial areas, on human communities have been receiving enormous attention. Understanding the transport and transformation of pollutants is essential, helping us perceive the factors affecting the physical and chemical processes and improve the precision of air pollution model. The field campaign “Effect of Megacities on the transport and transformation of pollutants on the Regional and Global scales over Asia (EMeRGe-Asia)”, led by University Bremen, Germany, and collaborated with Academia Sinica, Taiwan, is aimed to investigate the characters and influence of pollution plumes using the new High Altitude and LOng Range (HALO) aircraft research platform. The chemical compositions of pollutants and aerosols were measured both during the research flights and from ground stations. The correlations between surface and aircraft measurments over Taiwan are carried out. Comparing the aircraft observations with the nearest ground-based measurements, the concentration of CO and O<sub>3</sub> were uniform within the boundary layer, while the distributions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NOx were not homogeneous. In addition, it is observed that the plumes from the major pollution sources in western Taiwan can be transported to high altitude, consistent with results from the high-resolution model simulation. By integrating the aircraft and ground based measurements, this facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of the transport and chemistry of plumes and aerosols from polluted sources."
