In this project, I analyzed simulation results and evaluated the impact on target regions, which usually have terrible air pollutions. In the next stage, we aim to applied zero and first-order chemical reactions into the model to inspect lifetime effect on the regions so as to understand the sources of the pollutant in those highly-polluted regions.
