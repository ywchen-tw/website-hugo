A single-step method combining material preparation and the actual glucose measurements via the in situ growth of Cu<sub>2</sub>O/Ag nanoparticles was reported. Mechanistically, I use glucose itself to reduce Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup> ions that are stabilized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bovine serum albumin under alkaline conditions to form Cu<sub>2</sub>O/Ag nanoparticles and produce a color change in solution due to plasmonic resonance at 400 nm, which can be related back to the concentration of glucose. This was also the research of my master thesis.
