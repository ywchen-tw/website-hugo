I am a research assistant working with 
<a href="http://www.rcec.sinica.edu.tw/index.php?action=member&cid=8&id=258" target="_blank">Dr. Yi-Chun Chen</a> 
in <a href="http://www.rcec.sinica.edu.tw/" target="_blank">Research Center of Environmental Changes</a> 
at <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en" target="_blank">Academia Sinica</a> in Taiwan. 
I received my master's degree in Chemistry at 
<a href="https://www.ch.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a> in 2018. 
I am keen for exploring aerosols and air pollution with 
aircraft observation, ground measurements and numerical models to realize their chemical transformation during the transport. 
I am also interested in the development of new device for measurements. Please find more detailed information about me in 
<a href="#research">"Research"</a> and 
<a href="#publications">"Publications."</a>
